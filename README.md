LearnLang - An Interactive Language Learning Platform
Project Overview
LearnLang is a dynamic and responsive educational website designed to help users learn new languages through an engaging and intuitive interface. Built with modern web technologies, the platform provides a seamless user experience across all devices, from mobile phones to desktop computers. The project features a clean, professional design powered by Material-UI and is structured for easy maintenance and future scalability.

Key Features
Responsive Design: The layout is fully adaptive, ensuring a flawless experience on any screen size.

Interactive UI Components: Utilizes a rich set of components from Material-UI, including custom cards, buttons, and text fields, to create a polished and modern look.

Scroll-Triggered Animations: Implements a custom hook using IntersectionObserver to trigger animations as users scroll, enhancing the visual flow and engagement.

Client-Side Routing: Uses React Router to provide smooth, single-page application navigation between different sections (Home, About Us, Courses, etc.) without page reloads.

Reusable Components: The application is built with a component-based architecture, allowing for easy reuse of elements like headers, pricing cards, and background assets.

Dynamic Backgrounds: Features a subtle and animated SVG background with educational and aspirational symbols (rocket and graduation hat), adding a unique touch to the landing page.

Technologies Used
React.js: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

Material-UI (MUI): A popular React UI framework that provides a comprehensive set of pre-designed components.

React Router DOM: For handling client-side routing and navigation.

CSS-in-JS (via Emotion): Utilized by Material-UI for styling components.

SVG: Scalable Vector Graphics for lightweight and high-quality icons in the background.
